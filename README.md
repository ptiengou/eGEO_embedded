Run with Python 3.7.1 on my PC and 3.6 on the Omega

Note: 
I am aware that sometimes conventions are not respected or even consistent, as I was still in the process of learning object-oriented programming with Python when working on this project. I tried to do my best, but there are some common "good habits" that I may have discovered only during the project. 
Some aspects of the code are also not optimal, in particular, it is not that straight-forward to change the variables that we want the smart meter to collect and store.
